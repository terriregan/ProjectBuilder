## Project Builder

### About
Project Builder is one of the applications in the [Bloom ToolKit](http://terriregan.herokuapp.com/work/bloom) suite of tools. It's purpose is create, manage and configure projects, generate deployment packages and handle general admin functions. The focus for version 1 was on project management. More specifically:
- load and display content associated with a particular project
- generate links and send requests for review via email
- add and remove quality assurance seals
- fetch content generated by other tools, trigger UI specific data transformation and launch the associated UI, either wrapped in a review module or in its final format as the end user will experience it
