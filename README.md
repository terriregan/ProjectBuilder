## Project Builder

### About
Project Builder is one of the applications in the [Bloom ToolKit](http://terriregan.herokuapp.com/work/bloom) suite of tools. For version 1, its goal was to fetch data created by other tools, transform that data into a UI specifc data format and launch an interface, either in review or release modes.  In addition, it provided functionality to apply Quality Assurance seals, send emails and display content associated with each project.

### Role
I was the lead developer.  All code is mine unless noted at top of a page.

### Technologies
